There is a growing literature on comparisons between reading in a digital environment and reading from printed material. In a review and meta-analysis of this research Delgado and colleagues [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6430174/#R11)] found a robust disadvantage to reading in a digital environment, otherwise known as “screen inferiority” [see also, [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6430174/#R12)]. Several mechanisms for this effect have been implicated, including the possibility that digital environments are inherently more distracting with scrolling and other aspects of the digital experience taking away cues and critical cognitive processing capacity from the task of comprehending the material [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6430174/#R13)]. The literature on the screen inferiority effect suggests that there may be robust evidence of the negative effects of technology on learning. However, the bulk of the research on screen inferiority has been conducted under controlled laboratory conditions. The conclusions of the meta-analyses by both Delgado _et al_. [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6430174/#R11)] and Kong, Seo, and Zhai [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6430174/#R12)] suggest that there are many complicating factors, such as the nature of the content, the amount of study time allocated, and demographic factors that could influence the effect outside the lab. As such, it remains uncertain as to when and how technologies influence reading and comprehension and what mechanisms might be responsible. Across the research literature, there are therefore some indicators of the possible negative implications of technology use for learning, but many unanswered questions remain about the implications in the real world
